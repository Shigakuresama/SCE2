# Zillow Scraping Proxy Services (Optional - for automatic property data enrichment)
# The system will try these in order. If none are configured, it falls back to direct scraping.
# You only need to configure ONE of these:

# Option 1: ScraperAPI (https://scraperapi.com/) - $49/month, most reliable
# Get your API key from: https://scraperapi.com/
SCRAPER_API_KEY=your_scraperapi_key_here

# Option 2: ZenRows (https://zenrows.com/) - $49/month, better success rate
# Get your API key from: https://zenrows.com/
ZENROWS_API_KEY=your_zenrows_key_here

# Option 3: RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com/) - Starting at $5/month, cheapest option
# Get your API key from: https://rapidapi.com/
# Then subscribe to a Zillow scraper API like: https://rapidapi.com/sparior-api/api/zillow-scraper
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here

# Note: Without proxy services, Zillow scraping will likely fail due to anti-bot protection.
# The extension will still work - you'll just manually enter square footage and year built.
